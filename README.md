To run the Cipher Website you must 
- First open a command prompt on the computer in administration mode.
- Navigate to the "helloapp" folder which contains the app.js file in the command prompt.
- Then type "npm start".
- Then open a browser and enter "localhost:5000/users". This will take you to the homepage to either create or log into an account.
- When you have finished, you can close the server by typing "ctrl + c" and follow the instructions.
